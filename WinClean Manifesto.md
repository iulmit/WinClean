# WinClean Manifesto

Computing is an extremely powerful and advanced technology compared to how it was 20 or 30 years ago. Since the first experimental computers in the early 1940s, computers haven't stopped getting more powerful and complex. Nowadays, even low-tier computers can perform several billions of calculations per second. It's really incredible to think that the device that you're using to read this right now is this powerful.
However,  what's infuriating is the usage that we make of computers. As we look back on us, the untrained majority, those that use Comic Sans, Windows, Google Chrome, we've become so dependent of computers over the years without understanding their deep and complex inner workings. We boot up our computers, run programs, play games, go in the internet and we've become intolerant to any sort of failure or latency. We often complain of the slowness of computers without ever thinking to all the complexity of making all what they offer actually work, i.e. programming. 
Should we be ashamed of that ? Should we instead bear unsatisfying computing experiences, and never complain, holding it in ?
Of course not. We should do the exact opposite. We shouldn't hesitate to complain, to get mad at the sight of the slightest latency. Why ? Billions of calculations per second. What can't you do with that ?
So when it doesn't work, let it all out, scream, and hate it. We should be furious at lazy programming, when the programmers haven't made even the slightest effort to write good, maintainable code that doesn't hide dozens of bugs. We must stand up against this spreading virus. 
Did you read all of that ? Just ask it, ask it for real, why does it always have to be so painstakingly SLOW !

Welcome to WinClean. Not a revolution. Just a realization.
