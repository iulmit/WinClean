# WinClean
Windows optimization and debloating utility. 

Allows the average Windows user to improve performance in a few clicks.

## Features

- Run *Batch*, *PowerShell*, and *Registry Editor* debloating scripts directly from WinClean's ergonomic user interface.
- Add custom scripts to futher debloat the system.
- But if you don't have the time to do all of that, simply click on "Select all safe" and "Run Scripts"

Basically, you know what's happening under the hood.

## Specs
